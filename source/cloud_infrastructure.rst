Cloud Infrastructure
====================

What is a "cloud"?
------------------

* The idea of a cloud is to provide shared resources to clients
  according to need, as well as to provide specialized services.
* Basically, if you're a web designer you don't have to figure out
  how to sys-admin in order to host your own website somewhere.
* If no one is requesting your service, it can be "spun down" and not
  use resources until requested

Why is it useful?
-----------------

* Saves resources
* Saves time
