The `OSU Open Source Lab <http://osuosl.org/>`_ provides quality hosting for
more than 160 open source projects. Along with delivering over 460 terabytes of
open source data a month, the OSL employs and mentors students to be expert
systems administrators and software developers ready to enter the industry. The
OSL encounters more demand for qualified students than the employees graduating
each year can supply. We'd like to give back to OSU and the wider open source
community by training interested students from all disciplines in the
real-world skills necessary for success as software developers and systems
engineers. To this end, we'll be offering an extracurricular training program
with 2 to 3 sessions per month through the school year, in which current OSL
students and software professionals will teach all topics that are essential for
success. Although hands-on labs will be offered later in the program, no initial
familiarity with software development or Linux will be assumed.

This program is based on the `PSU Braindump <http://braindump.cat.pdx.edu>`_,
where for 21 years they have been turning PSU students into sysadmins who have
rapidly been flowing into the growing number of startups in Portland.

The DevOps BootCamp program will be dynamically shaping itself based on the
feedback we get from  interested students.
