Know your licenses
------------------

.. note::

    I am not a lawyer.

    http://opensource.org/licenses is pretty cool

    " Freely used, modified, and shared"

    :MIT/X11:
      Short, permissive, says attribution and no liability. Doesn't discuss
      copyright. Can convert to Apache 2

    :Apache:
      Short, permissive, goes in every file, grants patent rights from
      contributors to users, author keeps copyright. Plays nice with GPL3 (?)

    :BSD: Attribution, keep copyright, no liability

    :AGPL:
      Demands source distribution even when software not distributed (for
      cloud/hosted)

    :GPL:
      Viral, copyleft. Viral = infects entire program if it links to GPL library
      or uses a single line of GPL'd code

    :LGPL: Fixes library linking issue with GPL

    :CC: Non-code content

    :scale: 60%

* Lurk more
* Make accounts
    * Mailing lists
    * IRC channels
    * Wikis
    * Issue trackers
* It's okay to make mistakes -- just try to learn from them.

Finding a project
-----------------

.. note::
  First contributions will be metric of how nice they are to newbies

  There's a thing where older project members get grumpy at newbies because
  they've answered the question over and over... read docs/faq then improve them

.. figure:: static/osslogos.jpg

    :scale: 60%

* `Openhatch <http://openhatch.org/>`_
* `BugsAhoy <http://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/>`_
* `Trending github projects <https://github.com/trending>`_
* `Showcased github projects <https://github.com/showcases>`__

.. nextslide::

* Easy bugs
* GSOC submitters who didn't get enough interns
* Search by language
* Search by project type -- find something that interests you (web dev?
  bioinformatics? video games?)
* Your immediate payment for contributions will be satisfaction, so pick
  something satisfying

* Read Contributing docs
* Do a thing!
    * Write a test
    * Fix a typo
    * Deploy and update the installation docs

DevOps Concerns
---------------

    :scale: 70%

* Configurations often managed in public repos
* Root can't be handed out to just anyone
* Build trust, contribute to project consistently
* Practice with the tools they use

Your Homework
-------------

* Find a project that you'd like to get involved with
* Join IRC, mailing lists, etc.
* Pull the code and run its tests using what you've learned
* Find something you can contribute to the project
* Discuss how it's going in ``#devopsbootcamp`` on irc.freenode.net
